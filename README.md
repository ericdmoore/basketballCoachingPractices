### Practice #1 (my wife covered for me)

### Practice #2
- No Direct Running (will be baked into other mini-games)
- Shooting Circle Warm Up
  - Shoot and Dribble around all the baskets in the gym for 3 minutes to warm up
- *Sharks & Dribblers*
  - Three Circles on the gym (or at least two rectangles)
  - Two Sharks + Rest of Team is a dribbler
  - Dribble in the safe zone for 30s + then you have to leave to another safe zone
  - But the sharks will try and take your ball away 
  - Complete as many journeys as you can
  - Each Shark stays a shark and will try to stop 5 journies, after that the person with the most journey's becomes a shark.
  - Sharks can have no ball {harder} or have to dribble too {easier}
  - Loose ball ties go to the dribbler
- Lay Up Chase
  - One Girl dribbles to lay up 
  - When she crosses half court other two girls will chase and rebound and box-out
  - Points for making the shot (5), points for Rebound (3 number of bounces)
- Loose Ball Race
  - Two Lines
  - Coach is distracting, and rolls a ball out on the court
  - Girls give chase
