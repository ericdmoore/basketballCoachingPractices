## Practice 1

- Loop Shoot Warm Up (During Arrival)
- Introductions
- Overview
    - Two Practices a week
    - Friday we may start with
    - At Least one of the days will have a scrimmage
    - I hope you make it to both practices; but if you miss it's not a big deal and its one of the reasons why we have two practices
    - Positions
    - Places
    - Coaches Command - Hold The Balls
    - Everytime the ball hits the ground after a hold the ball command - earns us some running at the end of practice
    - if you dont understand - stop raise your hand - and ask
    - I am going to move fast - maybe too fast - if you dont know what Im talking about - then you need to ask. If I ask you to do something using words you dont know - that's your fault for not asking. Ask questions.

- Mental Drills
    - Locations (Note: There are multiple locaitons - so if you can't get your foot on it choose another one)
        - Half Court Circle
        - Free Throw Line
        - Elbow
        - Baseline
        - Top of The Arc
        - The Block
            - ball side block
            - away side block
        - Sideline
        - Corner
        - Short Corner
        - Free Throw Extension (or Extended Freet Throw)
        - Half Court line
        - The Lane
        - Mid counrt hash
    - Concepts
        - Walk Your Defender Away 
        - Cut To The Hoop
        - Pop Out Away From The Hoop
        - Screen / Pick
        - Positioning 
        - Box Outs
        - Closeouts and Angles
        - Shooting Form
            - Practice This at home
            - lay on your back shoot and catch
            - focus on spinning the ball, protecting your face, and ALWAYS catching the ball - which is much easier if you control your shot
        - Pass, Flash, Shoot, Screen
            - If your Defender can guard two Colts - you are in the wrong spot.
            - Defender, Lets say some St Rita girl knows about this two,
                - she goes and hides in the halfc


- Offense: With a Plan, we make choices to take advantage of a defense who is guessing.
    - Our Plan, allows us to make a choices
        - make choices based on what I like to do, 
        - based on what the defender did 
        - ultimately choose an action *for ME* for success based on what my defender just did
        - So to say that one more time we want options so that no matter what the defender did, we can pick the other one to make the defender feel like they guessed wrong.
        - Rock Paper Scissors - I go last. Think of offense as rock paper scissors
    - So Offense is about spacing and choices
    - Pass, Flash

- Defense: Create Frustration and Exhaustion for your opponent
    - Defense is about heart and effort
    - Defense is about reactions and using your brain
    - Defense is about forcing the offense to eat their vegatables 
        - no candy buckets when you play our team.



#### Shooting
- There as you get better at shooting, I may come talk to you about how you shoot the ball
- Is it more fun to make shots or miss shots
- (In order of importance) Load, Lift, Line, Laces
- Guide Hand & Shooting hand
- Load Legs & Hips:
    - "Loading" is like squishing a spring
    - Catch & Load
    - A Spring will not jump unless you squish it first
    - A long spring is a boring spring
    - a squished spring is exciting - it could go off anytime
- Lift: 
    - Ball Near Your Forehead
    - Ball Over Your Shooting Hand
    - Ready to Drop Your Guide Hand
- Line:
    - Down Your shoulder to the back of the rim
    - 


### Speed Dribble & Jump Stop
Overview: 
- We want to be able to create space
- to do that we need to be quick
- quick means becoming fast, and becoming stopped - as fast as you can
- We are stopped - I am going to
Setup:
- 3ish lines
- Coach gives you defense hands
- players adjust
- on whistle, players RACE to coach and jump stop, and protect the ball again


### Dribbling
- Regular (Dominant hand)
- Alternating
- Right Hand Only
- Left Hand Only
- Backwards
- Cross Overs
- Sideways or shuffling
- Zig Zag


#### Location Races
Coach calls out first method and first location
- eg: "Dribbling to Half Court Circle"
- one of the first few to get there - will be selected 
- Coach would ask: What is our next method or location
    Violet: What is our next method: "Cross overs" she responds
    Coach says: "To an Elbow" - team scatters


#### [Best Defensive Position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm34CsIixC4&t=1048s)

- Ball Pressure - Make guard go east west - we dont give up a north south
- All defenders should be able to see player and ball
    - You want to be close enough to a passing lane to steal the pass
    - if you can't, you need to move back
    - you want to take advantage of 
- D that is 1 pass away 
    - arm contests the passing lane (standing half way from ball and player)
    - eyes are chekcing ball, player, ball, player, repeat
- 2 passes away - 1 foot in the paint
- 3 passes away 
    - sit on the mid line 
    - ready to help defend our house - you are the castle guard who closes the draw bridge - protecting our halloween candy
    - responsible for pushing the ball back up or around
    - NO baseline passes or dribbles


#### [Spin Out - Face Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm34CsIixC4&t=52s)
    Offense:
    - Rip through
    - Create Arm Contact
    - Protect The Ball

    Defense:
    - You MAIN job is to be a mirror who is ALWAYS in front of the ball
    - For BONUS (Extra Credit) - you can guess where the ball is going - and take the ball away


#### Two on 1
- three lines
- two outside lines near arc (two offense lines)
- center line is defense
- Dribble out past midcourt hash
- Defense pounds the free throw line
- 3 passes max - 1 shot
- switch over one line after every possession 

#### [Wing Box Drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm34CsIixC4&t=149s)

C - Corner
B - Block 
E - Extension

- Start at C Then Get Open
- Walk Defender Towards The Block - then Pop @E
- *C* (some steps towards *B*) - then pop to *E* (create space)
- @E catch pass, and face up
    - Decide: Pass, Shoot, Dribble
    - Pass: Step Through or Across to protect The Ball back to passer
    - Defender may slide over to try to frustrate the passing lane
- Cut Rear Cut the Defender (E --> B) To the hoop (not a banana cut - straight like an arrow)
    - Watching for the ball while you are running in space
    - Yess Ball, Shot a Candy Shot
    - No ball, pop out to @C
- Walk defender up to "E", then cut back to B
    - catch and shoot

#### [2v2 Swing Or Shoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm34CsIixC4&t=981s)
- Coach commands swing or shoot
- Offense Wants to rebound and shoot again
- Defense wants to the ball to switch to offense



#### Attacking Handicap
- offense on baseline
- defense on FT extended line
- Coach throws a O-player the ball to bring down
- that defensive player has to touch the base line and sprint back to help with defense
- Optionally: Coach May add a defense name who also has to "touch up" on the baseline first 
- Every possession will be a 5v4, maybe even 5v3, or 5v2

- After Bucket:
    how to keep the handicap going?
